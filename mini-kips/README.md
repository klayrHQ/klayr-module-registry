# Mini-KIP Format and Structure

Mini-KIPs should be written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ "Markdown") format. A template Mini KIP is provided below as the basis for all new proposals that can be created in this folder. As necessary, code examples may be used. These should be written in JavaScript or simple pseudocode depending on the needs of the particular situation. 

Each KIP should have the following parts:

- Abstract—A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue / improvement / module being addressed.

- Copyright—Each KIP must be licensed under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ "Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Universal").

- Specification—The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature / module. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Klayr platforms. In the special case where the choice of a library is critical (e.g. security), a recommendation about libraries and reasoning should be included.

- Motivation—The motivation is critical for Mini-KIPs that want to change or add to the Klayr protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the Mini-KIP solves.

- Rationale—The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternative designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

- Backwards compatibility—All Mini-KIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The Mini-KIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.
