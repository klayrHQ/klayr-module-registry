# Klayr Bounty Program


Klayr’s Bounty Program thrives on community innovation to enhance our ecosystem. This program is offered to parties that would like to contribute by applying to an open bounty issue and/or reporting bugs or vulnerabilities. 

> The current program strongly focuses on Tech building blocks (Modules): Reusable Modules for Sidechain Developers, and Public Audits on Modules. These scopes are not exclusive, additional functionalities or enhancements to existing features can be included. 


### Eligibility
Before you apply for a bounty from Klayr, make sure you check off these criteria. 

- General KYC and AML requirements 

Klayr's Bounty Program requires applicants, both individuals and companies, to undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) process involving the submission of identity and address verification documents to uphold program integrity and regulatory compliance.

- Are you of legal age to enter into a binding contract in your jurisdiction?
  
This means you must be at least the minimum age specified by law in your location, typically 18 years or older, to legally agree to the terms and conditions of a contract.

- Finish before starting a new one 

Teams must complete their current bounty issue before applying for a new one unless we make an exception.

- Open-source technical projects

All blockchain-related code must be open-sourced and not rely on closed-source software. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT, or Unlicense are also fine.

- No token sale projects 

We usually don't fund projects that have already had a successful token sale.

- Real utility

We prioritize projects that deliver tangible value to users. While this isn't a strict requirement, it will significantly enhance the appeal of your grant application.

- No shady stuff

We don't fund projects involved in gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or any criminal activities.

- Payment criteria

Bounty funds are only paid to a KLAYR wallet owned by the grantee. 


### Application process

- New issue/module proposal
   
Report a bug or vulnerability, or ideate a new bounty proposal for evaluation. The report must include a clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. Use the Klayr Issue Template.

- Open issues/modules
   
You find the solution for an open issue! Submit your proposal for evaluation. The report must include a clear description of the issue and steps to reproduce it. Use the Klayr Issue Template.

### Stages

``Backlog``: Proposed issues/modules are under review and open to comments and suggestions from the entire community. The Bounty Committee evaluates the submissions. If any issue/module is found valuable for the Klayr ecosystem, the Final issue/module is moved to the next stage. 

``Open-to-submission``: Under this label, the tasks are presented to the community and open to application. Applicants must present solutions using the Klayr Issue template form, including the Module description, steps to reproduce it, and relevant details. 

``In review``: The evaluation process to assign the task is done by the Bounty Committee. 

``Allocated``: Once the issue/module is assigned to a bounty hunter, we might ask to re-write the issue/module using a KIP (Klayr Improvement Proposal) template to guarantee technical specifications and a rationale for the feature. In this stage, the applicant works on the issue until completion. Revision of the task solution and verification may include requesting more information, or clarification. If we ask to resubmit the proposal with more details, take no more than 10 working days to complete it, or we'll have to move on to the next Bounty Hunter. Progress reports are submitted through Pull requests. 

``Completed``: Bounty is completed, and being reviewed by the Committee. After approval, you'll be requested to fill in a compliance review form to ensure eligibility (General KYC and AML requirements). For this topic, communications between participants and the Bounty Committee are conducted on Telegram. Once the eligibility is confirmed, the process moves to the "Payment" stage.  

``Payment``: Compensation in KLY tokens, with the exchange rate determined at the time of successful review confirmation.

**Are you good to go?**
